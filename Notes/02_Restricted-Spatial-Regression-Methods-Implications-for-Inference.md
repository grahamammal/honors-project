Khan and Kori (2020)

I need to go through this paper and look at everything they cite! some could be very useful. 


## 9/2 Notes 

### Notes

- This paper claims to blow all the work on restricted spatial regression out of the water. I find it hard to believe no one has checked whteher what the claim is true before publishing their own papers, but lets hear them out.
- Claims that RSR is simply an overfit glm, with credible intervals often times wholy contained within credible intervals of non-spatial glm, and approximatly equal means. Claims this is especially true where there is a true correlation between space and predictor, as in an unmeasured spatial confounder.


### Questions

- Should spatial models have larger variances than their non-spatial counterparts? I'm not sure about the truth of this statement.
