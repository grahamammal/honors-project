Talk to holly about finding a continuous outcome data that changes over time. Ideally measurements at the same locations. 

Try to work with something where correlation structure is isotropic (doesn't vary over space). 


Think about the epa, air quality models maybe? Berkleyearth air quality lab has a lot of data


Could also request data from the minnesota department of health. https://education.mn.gov/MDE/dse/health/mss/

For census tract or quite small using centroid is fine to get points, otherwise need to change correlation structure.
