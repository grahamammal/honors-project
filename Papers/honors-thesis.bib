Our approach, named SPOCK, has the additional benefit of providing a fast and simple computational method to estimate the parameters. Also, it does not constrain the distribution class assumed for the spatial error term.

This phenomenon is known as spatial confounding and has been studied primarily in the case where the spatial support of the process being studied is discrete (e.g., areal spatial data). In this case, the most common approach suggested is restricted spatial regression (RSR) in which the spatial random effects are constrained to be orthogonal to the fixed effects. We consider spatial confounding and RSR in the geostatistical (continuous spatial support) setting. We show that RSR provides computational benefits relative to the confounded SGLMM, but that Bayesian credible intervals under RSR can be inappropriately narrow under model misspecification. We propose a posterior predictive approach to alleviating this potential problem and discuss the appropriateness of RSR in a variety of situations. We illustrate RSR and SGLMM approaches through simulation studies and an analysis of malaria frequencies in The Gambia, Africa. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

When fitting spatial regressions for such data, one needs to account for dependence to ensure reliable inference for the regression coefficients. The spatial generalized linear mixed model (SGLMM) offers a very popular and flexible approach to modeling such data, but the SGLMM suffers from three major shortcomings: (1) uninterpretability of parameters due to spatial confounding, (2) variance inflation due to spatial confounding, and (3) high-dimensional spatial random effects that make fully Bayesian inference for such models computationally challenging. We propose a new parameterization of the SGLMM that alleviates spatial confounding and speeds computation by greatly reducing the dimension of the spatial random effects. We illustrate the application of our approach to simulated binary, count, and Gaussian spatial datasets, and to a large infant mortality dataset.},

	abstract = {Many statisticians have had the experience of fitting a linear model with uncorrelated errors, then adding a spatially-correlated error term (random effect) and finding that the estimates of the fixed-effect coefficients have changed substantially. We show that adding a spatially-correlated error term to a linear model is equivalent to adding a saturated collection of canonical regressors, the coefficients of which are shrunk toward zero, where the spatial map determines both the canonical regressors and the relative extent of the coefficients' shrinkage. Adding a spatially-correlated error term can also be seen as inflating the error variances associated with specific contrasts of the data, where the spatial map determines the contrasts and the extent of error-variance inflation. We show how to avoid this spatial confounding by restricting the spatial random effect to the orthogonal complement (residual space) of the fixed effects, which we call restricted spatial regression. We consider five proposed interpretations of spatial confounding and draw implications about what, if anything, one should do about it. In doing so, we debunk the common belief that adding a spatially-correlated random effect adjusts fixed-effect estimates for spatially-structured missing covariates.

In this setting, the Poisson data model with a latent Gaussian process model has become the de facto model. However, this model can be difficult to use in high dimensional settings, where the data may be tabulated over different variables, geographic regions, and times. These computational difficulties are further exacerbated by acknowledging that count-valued data are naturally non-Gaussian. Thus, many of the current approaches, in Bayesian inference, require one to carefully calibrate a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique. We avoid MCMC methods that require tuning by developing a new conjugate multivariate distribution. Specifically, we introduce a multivariate log-gamma distribution and provide substantial methodological development of independent interest including: results regarding conditional distributions, marginal distributions, an asymptotic relationship with the multivariate normal distribution, and full-conditional distributions for a Gibbs sampler. To incorporate dependence between variables, regions, and time points, a multivariate spatio-temporal mixed effects model (MSTM) is used. To demonstrate our methodology we use data obtained from the US Census Bureau’s Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) program. In particular, our approach is motivated by the LEHD’s Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWIs), which constitute current estimates of important US economic variables.},

Additionally, many multivariate spatio-temporal areal data sets are extremely high dimensional, which leads to practical issues when formulating statistical models. For example, we analyze Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI) published by the US Census Bureau’s Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) program. QWIs are available by different variables, regions, and time points, resulting in millions of tabulations. Despite their already expansive coverage, by adopting a fully Bayesian framework, the scope of the QWIs can be extended to provide estimates of missing values along with associated measures of uncertainty. Motivated by the LEHD, and other applications in federal statistics, we introduce the multivariate spatio-temporal mixed effects model (MSTM), which can be used to efficiently model high-dimensional multivariate spatio-temporal areal data sets. The proposed MSTM extends the notion of Moran’s I basis functions to the multivariate spatio-temporal setting. This extension leads to several methodological contributions, including extremely effective dimension reduction, a dynamic linear model for multivariate spatio-temporal areal processes, and the reduction of a high-dimensional parameter space using a novel parameter model.},

Location-specific covariates are often included as fixed effects in a GLMM and may be collinear with the spatial random effect, which can negatively affect inference. We propose a dynamic approach to account for spatial dependence that incorporates scientific knowledge of the spatio-temporal data generating process. Our approach relies on a dynamic spatio-temporal model that explicitly incorporates location-specific covariates. We illustrate our approach with a spatially varying ecological diffusion model implemented using a computationally efficient homogenization technique. We apply our model to understand individual-level and location-specific risk factors associated with chronic wasting disease in white-tailed deer from Wisconsin, USA and estimate the location the disease was first introduced. We compare our approach to several existing methods that are commonly used in spatial statistics. Our spatio-temporal approach resulted in a higher predictive accuracy when compared to methods based on optimal spatial prediction, obviated confounding among the spatially indexed covariates and the spatial random effect, and provided additional information that will be important for containing disease outbreaks.},

	abstract = {Summary. With scientific data available at geocoded locations, investigators are increasingly turning to spatial process models for carrying out statistical inference. Over the last decade, hierarchical models implemented through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods have become especially popular for spatial modelling, given their flexibility and power to fit models that would be infeasible with classical methods as well as their avoidance of possibly inappropriate asymptotics. However, fitting hierarchical spatial models often involves expensive matrix decompositions whose computational complexity increases in cubic order with the number of spatial locations, rendering such models infeasible for large spatial data sets. This computational burden is exacerbated in multivariate settings with several spatially dependent response variables. It is also aggravated when data are collected at frequent time points and spatiotemporal process models are used. With regard to this challenge, our contribution is to work with what we call predictive process models for spatial and spatiotemporal data. Every spatial (or spatiotemporal) process induces a predictive process model (in fact, arbitrarily many of them). The latter models project process realizations of the former to a lower dimensional subspace, thereby reducing the computational burden. Hence, we achieve the flexibility to accommodate non-stationary, non-Gaussian, possibly multivariate, possibly spatiotemporal processes in the context of large data sets. We discuss attractive theoretical properties of these predictive processes. We also provide a computational template encompassing these diverse settings. Finally, we illustrate the approach with simulated and real data sets.},

	abstract = {Estimating the long-term health impact of air pollution using an ecological spatio-temporal study design is a challenging task, due to the presence of residual spatio-temporal autocorrelation in the health counts after adjusting for the covariate effects. This autocorrelation is commonly modelled by a set of random effects represented by a Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) prior distribution, as part of a hierarchical Bayesian model. However, GMRF models typically assume the random effects are globally smooth in space and time, and thus are likely to be collinear to any spatially and temporally smooth covariates such as air pollution. Such collinearity leads to poor estimation performance of the estimated fixed effects, and motivated by this epidemiological problem, this paper proposes new GMRF methodology to allow for localised spatio-temporal smoothing. This means random effects that are either geographically or temporally adjacent are allowed to be autocorrelated or conditionally independent, which allows more flexible autocorrelation structures to be represented. This increased flexibility results in improved fixed effects estimation compared with global smoothing models, which is evidenced by our simulation study. The methodology is then applied to the motivating study investigating the long-term effects of air pollution on respiratory ill health in Greater Glasgow, Scotland between 2007 and 2011.},

The setting where the number of locations yielding observations is too large to fit the desired hierarchical spatial random effects models using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods is considered. This problem is exacerbated in spatial-temporal and multivariate settings where many observations occur at each location. The recently proposed predictive process, motivated by kriging ideas, aims to maintain the richness of desired hierarchical spatial modeling specifications in the presence of large datasets. A shortcoming of the original formulation of the predictive process is that it induces a positive bias in the non-spatial error term of the models. A modified predictive process is proposed to address this problem. The predictive process approach is knot-based leading to questions regarding knot design. An algorithm is designed to achieve approximately optimal spatial placement of knots. Detailed illustrations of the modified predictive process using multivariate spatial regression with both a simulated and a real dataset are offered.},

	abstract = {Summary. Structured additive regression models are perhaps the most commonly used class of models in statistical applications. It includes, among others, (generalized) linear models, (generalized) additive models, smoothing spline models, state space models, semiparametric regression, spatial and spatiotemporal models, log-Gaussian Cox processes and geostatistical and geoadditive models. We consider approximate Bayesian inference in a popular subset of structured additive regression models, latent Gaussian models, where the latent field is Gaussian, controlled by a few hyperparameters and with non-Gaussian response variables. The posterior marginals are not available in closed form owing to the non-Gaussian response variables. For such models, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods can be implemented, but they are not without problems, in terms of both convergence and computational time. In some practical applications, the extent of these problems is such that Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling is simply not an appropriate tool for routine analysis. We show that, by using an integrated nested Laplace approximation and its simplified version, we can directly compute very accurate approximations to the posterior marginals. The main benefit of these approximations is computational: where Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms need hours or days to run, our approximations provide more precise estimates in seconds or minutes. Another advantage with our approach is its generality, which makes it possible to perform Bayesian analysis in an automatic, streamlined way, and to compute model comparison criteria and various predictive measures so that models can be compared and the model under study can be challenged.},

	abstract = {Inference for spatial generalized linear mixed models (SGLMMs) for high-dimensional non-Gaussian spatial data is computationally intensive. The computational challenge is due to the high-dimensional random effects and because Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for these models tend to be slow mixing. Moreover, spatial confounding inflates the variance of fixed effect (regression coefficient) estimates. Our approach addresses both the computational and confounding issues by replacing the high-dimensional spatial random effects with a reduced-dimensional representation based on random projections. Standard MCMC algorithms mix well and the reduced-dimensional setting speeds up computations per iteration. We show, via simulated examples, that Bayesian inference for this reduced-dimensional approach works well both in terms of inference as well as prediction; our methods also compare favorably to existing “reduced-rank” approaches. We also apply our methods to two real world data examples, one on bird count data and the other classifying rock types. Supplementary material for this article is available online.},

	abstract = {The issue of spatial confounding between the spatial random effect and the fixed effects in regression analyses has been identified as a concern in the statistical literature. Multiple authors have offered perspectives and potential solutions. In this article, for the areal spatial data setting, we show that many of the methods designed to alleviate spatial confounding can be viewed as special cases of a general class of models. We refer to this class as restricted spatial regression (RSR) models, extending terminology currently in use. We offer a mathematically based exploration of the impact that RSR methods have on inference for regression coefficients for the linear model. We then explore whether these results hold in the generalized linear model setting for count data using simulations. We show that the use of these methods have counterintuitive consequences which defy the general expectations in the literature. In particular, our results and the accompanying simulations suggest that RSR methods will typically perform worse than nonspatial methods. These results have important implications for dimension reduction strategies in spatial regression modeling. Specifically, we demonstrate that the problems with RSR models cannot be fixed with a selection of “better” spatial basis vectors or dimension reduction techniques.

	abstract = {Gaussian processes are widely used in nonparametric regression, classification and spatiotemporal modelling, facilitated in part by a rich literature on their theoretical properties. However, one of their practical limitations is expensive computation, typically on the order of n3 where n is the number of data points, in performing the necessary matrix inversions. For large datasets, storage and processing also lead to computational bottlenecks, and numerical stability of the estimates and predicted values degrades with increasing n. Various methods have been proposed to address these problems, including predictive processes in spatial data analysis and the subset-of-regressors technique in machine learning. The idea underlying these approaches is to use a subset of the data, but this raises questions concerning sensitivity to the choice of subset and limitations in estimating fine-scale structure in regions that are not well covered by the subset. Motivated by the literature on compressive sensing, we propose an alternative approach that involves linear projection of all the data points onto a lower-dimensional subspace. We demonstrate the superiority of this approach from a theoretical perspective and through simulated and real data examples.},
