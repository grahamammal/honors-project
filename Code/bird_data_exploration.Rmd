These data come from the Breeding Bird Survey, found at: [](https://doi.org/10.5066/F7W0944J). I will be doing House Finches (Carpodacus mexicanus AOU 05195) from 1966-2000 and Carolina Wren (Thryothorus ludovicanus, AOU 07180) from 1967-2014. This is following the book Spatiotemporal Statistics in R. Data were collected ~yearly along routes. I believe I'll need to impute data for missing years. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
file_names <- list.files("../Data/States/States", pattern = "*.zip") 
  

csv_paths <- glue("../Data/States/States/{file_names}") %>% 
  map(unzip, exdir = "../Data/States")
```

```{r}
csv_names <- list.files("../Data/States", pattern = "*.csv") 


glue("../Data/States/{csv_names}") %>% 
  map(read_csv)
```
